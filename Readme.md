This repo contains the code to our prototype.

## OUR SOLUTION

Sharent is a platform that assists business owners, people, or organizations with a working space, office, flats, or lands. 

Sharent rents out spaces to the public, rents lands, and provides for sharing of lands, flats, spaces, or offices at a reasonable price.
